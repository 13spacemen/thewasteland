<h1>Welcome to Fallout13: Test Server!</h1>
MRP/HRP<br>
Rooles:<br>

1. No racism, slurs, etc. Be nice.<br>
2. Always stay in character. Use OOC/LOOC if you need to.<br>
3. Try to roleplay before attacking/killing people.<br>
4. Wait until 1hr30min before attacking faction bases. Rule 3 applies.<br>
5. Don't break into buildings with closed doors without staff approval.<br>
6. ERP if you want but don't make it the main focus of the server.<br>
