Welcome to our Fallout Style SS13 Server.<br>
Rules:<br>

Welcome to our Fallout Style SS13 Server.<br>
Rules:<br>

1: You must be 18 years of age to join the community and play in our servers as there are adult themed references and interactions.<br>

2: No racism and no Toxicity.<br>

3: Always stay in character, only break away in LOOC or OOC to resolve issues as needed.<br>

4: You may raid bases or player homes 2 hours into a round however you must ahelp it to state that you're intending to raid with your reason and intentions to notify administration to avoid poor escalation issues. Be robust with your talking, emotes and combat indicators!<br>

5: Try to roleplay when fighting, always escalate properly and try to work things out before resorting to mechanics.<br>

6: Keep characters individual, do not respawn as the same character if they’ve died in that round and do not jump roles between major factions without valid IC reasoning.<br>

7: Do not abuse mechanics intentionally for a PVP or PVE advantage. You may use things like barricades, buildings and such for PVE but do not throw a lock on a door during PVP to try to gain an unfair advantage. <br>

8: Do not use meta communications during the round. Don’t go into discord to message your friend to come save you when you die. Once a round ends you are free to talk about what happened but do not use this information as if you actually know it in character.<br>

9: Do not abuse any game breaking mechanics.<br>

10: English is the main required language to use while playing. You must speak English or be able to write it in order for our staff to assist you as well as the community.<br>

11: Do not kill AFK or disconnected players. Move them somewhere safe but do not steal from them or harm them.<br>

12: In order to fight there must be escalation. It begins with a conversation, emotes with intentions and combat ready from both sides before fighting mechanically may begin. Be polite and respectable so both players are ready to fight before starting.<br>

12.1: If you enter a faction base without approval from the faction you may be shot on sight. During escalation if the attacker gives you rules such as "If you pull a gun you will be shot" then they may shoot you if you pull a gun. If you call for backup on your radio or pip boy then you are accepting escalation and may be shot. If you attempt to run away immediately when a player is escalating on you they may fight you but it MUST be clear that the attacker IS HOSTILE and has clearly made their intentions of violence known. Do not just point to a person and if they run immediately shoot them. Give chase and if you pulled a gun already telling them to comply with an order and THEN they run by all means open fire. Also if you steal something wordlessly and run away immediately without any emotes or interaction with the person you steal from you are valid and may be shot on sight.<br>

Examples: A player runs up and steals a stack of caps from a vending machine then takes off. They are valid and may be killed without any interaction.<br>

A player tells another to STOP moving or be shot and the player runs, they may be killed.<br>

A player runs into a faction base deep picking things up and not communicating with anyone or when spotted tries to flee. They can be shot on sight.<br>

A player is stopped and told to get on the ground as they are going to be kidnapped. That player calls for help on their radio, they are accepting escalation and may be shot.<br>

13: Erotic roleplay is allowed but you must follow a few guidelines. First off no underage references at ALL. Second you must get OOC consent from the player to do so. If you’re doing a non consensual scene you both must verify that you’re accepting it. Third try to be subtle about it and keep to yourself. This way you wont get judged, you won't be harassed and you can enjoy your roleplay in privacy.<br>

14: Do not judge people's roleplay, don’t poke fun, don’t go out of your way to harass people or create grudges. Have fun and enjoy yourself. People will make mistakes, as you make mistakes, learn from them and be patient as others do the same so that way we can create something great.<br>

15: Do not share any personal information of any of the community members to anyone else. No private information should be disclosed within server resources. If there is a personal feud between individuals that involves personal information outside of the community your access to our resources will be denied to protect our community members.<br>

16: Do not destroy bodies once you've killed them. Do not decapitate, do not remove their brains, and do not shoot their organs out. Once they seize up and die from being shot or melee'd to death leave them be. Also do NOT hide the bodies to attempt to round end them. Only as major factions may you take bodies and ONLY with the intentions of reviving the person to be a prisoner or to trade them back to their respective factions.<br>

17: If you die and stay dead for an excess of 10 minutes then you will not remember the events that lead up to your death prior when revived.<br>

18: Do not hold grudges and pursue people for things that happened in previous rounds. IE: Do not hunt down someone who killed you last round to kill them the following round. Be creative but do not hold grudges.<br>

19: No faction allies. The Major factions cannot ally to take each other down during raids or major skirmishes without a VERY good in character reason. Situational alliances may not last beyond the round either. Minor factions may create alliances however they only last for the round they were formed in. Ex: A small raider gang being hired by the NCR, Legion or BOS to aide them.<br>

20: If you intend to raid a faction you must only pick one enemy per round that you intend to fight. While we are allowing more fighting than any other server in this regard we do not want the NCR, Legion, Enclave or BOS to go around killing off every single other faction from the game in a round. Give it some good RP, Pick one faction and have a GOOD fight over it. We don't want one faction running around killing off the entire server.<br>
