Welcome to our Fallout Style SS13 Server.<br>
Rules:<br>

1: You must be 18 years of age to join the community and play in our servers as there are adult themed references and interactions.<br>

2: No racism and no Toxicity.<br>

3: Always stay in character, only break away in LOOC or OOC to resolve issues as needed.<br>

4: You must wait until the 1 hour 30 minute mark in order to raid enemy bases with the regular escalation rules.<br>

5: Try to roleplay when fighting, always escalate properly and try to work things out before resorting to mechanics.<br>

6: Keep characters individual, do not respawn as the same character if they’ve died in that round and do not jump roles between major
 factions without valid IC reasoning.<br>

7: Do not abuse mechanics intentionally for a PVP or PVE advantage.
You may use things like barricades, buildings and such for PVE but do not throw a lock on a door during PVP to try to gain an unfair 
advantage. <br>

8: Do not use meta communications during the round. Don’t go into discord to message your friend to come save you when you die. 
Once a round ends you are free to talk about what happened but do not use this information as if you actually know it in character. 
Example: A character joins a new faction and tells a group out of game after the round ends. 
That group of players should not then take that information and use it ICLY as if they learned it ingame. 
Pretend you don’t know until you are told ingame.<br>

9: English is the main required language to use while playing. You must speak english or be able to write it in order for our staff to
assist you as well as the community. We don’t turn down anyone though if you can’t speak English that’s fine but you’ll have to work with us
 if an issue arises.<br>

10: Do not kill AFK or disconnected players. Move them somewhere safe but do not steal from them or harm them.<br>

11: In order to fight there must be escalation. It begins with a conversation, emotes with intentions and combat ready from both sides
 before fighting mechanically may begin. Be polite and respectable so both players are ready to fight before starting.<br>

11.1: If you enter a faction base without approval from the faction you may be shot on sight. 
During escalation if the attacker gives you rules such as "If you pull a gun you will be shot" then they may shoot you if you pull a gun.
 If you call for backup on your radio or pip boy then you are accepting escalation and may be shot. If you attempt to run away immediately
  when a player is escalating on you they may fight you but it MUST be clear that the attacker IS HOSTILE and has clearly made their 
  intentions of violence known. Do not just point to a person and if they run immediately shoot them. Give chase and if you pulled a gun
   already telling them to comply with an order and THEN they run by all means open fire. Also if you steal something wordlessly and run 
   away immediately without any emotes or interaction with the person you steal from you are valid and may be shot on sight.<br>

Examples: A player runs up and steals a stack of caps from a vending machine then takes off. They are valid and may be killed without any 
interaction.<br>

A player tells another to STOP moving or be shot and the player runs, they may be killed.<br>

A player runs into a faction base deep picking things up and not communicating with anyone or when spotted tries to flee. 
They can be shot on sight.<br>

A player is stopped and told to get on the ground as they are going to be kidnapped. That player calls for help on their radio, 
they are accepting escalation and may be shot.<br>

12: Erotic roleplay is allowed but you must follow a few guidelines. First off no underage references at ALL. 
Second you must get OOC consent from the player to do so. If you’re doing a non consensual scene you both must verify that you’re accepting
 it. Third try to be subtle about it and keep to yourself. This way you wont get judged, you won't be harassed and you can enjoy your 
 roleplay in privacy.<br>

13: Do not judge people's roleplay, don’t poke fun, don’t go out of your way to harass people or create grudges. 
Have fun and enjoy yourself. People will make mistakes, as you make mistakes, learn from them and be patient as others do the same so 
that way we can create something great.<br>

14: Do not share any personal information of any of the community members to anyone else. No private information should be 
disclosed within server resources. If there is a personal feud between individuals that involves personal information outside of 
the community your access to our resources will be denied to protect our community members.<br>

15: Do not hide a body after you’ve killed a person in order to keep them out of the round. Factions may capture bodies of those they’ve 
killed but only if their intentions are to revive the person and enslave or trade the player back to the faction. 
Do not destroy a player's brain on purpose to remove them from the game.<br>

16: If you die and stay dead for an excess of 10 minutes then you will not remember the events that lead up to your death prior when revived.<br>
